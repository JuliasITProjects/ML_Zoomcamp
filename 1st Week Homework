# First Week Homework




"""Question 1:
What's the version of Pandas that you installed?"""

import pandas as pd
print(pd.__version__)

"""Answer: my pandas version is 2.1.0"""





"""Question 2.
How many columns are in the dataset?"""

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('S:\ML Course\Homework Week 1\datasets_master_housing.csv')

# Get the number of columns
num_columns = df.shape[1]
print(f"The dataset has {num_columns} columns.")

"""Answer: 10"""





"""Question 3.
Which columns in the dataset have missing values?"""

import pandas as pd

missing_values = df.isnull()
missing_counts = missing_values.sum()

print(missing_counts[missing_counts > 0].index.tolist())

"""Answer: total_bedrooms"""





"""Question 4.
How many unique values does the ocean_proximity column have?"""

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('S:\ML Course\Homework Week 1\datasets_master_housing.csv')

for column in df.columns:
    print(df[column].value_counts())

"""Answer: 5"""





"""Question 5.
What's the average value of the median_house_value for the houses located near the bay?"""

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('S:\ML Course\Homework Week 1\datasets_master_housing.csv')

print(f"Average median_house_value for houses near the bay: ${average_median_house_value_near_bay:,.2f}")

"""Answer: 259212"""





"""Question 6.
Calculate the average of total_bedrooms column in the dataset.
Use the fillna method to fill the missing values in total_bedrooms with the mean value from the previous step.
Now, calculate the average of total_bedrooms again.
Has it changed?"""

import pandas as pd

# Print the results
print(f"Initial Average total_bedrooms: {initial_average_total_bedrooms:.2f}")
print(f"Average total_bedrooms after fillna: {average_total_bedrooms_after_fillna:.2f}")

"""Answer: no"""





"""Question 7:
Select all the options located on islands.
Select only columns housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms.
Get the underlying NumPy array. Let's call it X.
Compute matrix-matrix multiplication between the transpose of X and X. To get the transpose, use X.T. Let's call the result XTX.
Compute the inverse of XTX.
Create an array y with values [950, 1300, 800, 1000, 1300].
Multiply the inverse of XTX with the transpose of X, and then multiply the result by y. Call the result w.
What's the value of the last element of w?"""

X = selected_columns.values

# Step 4: Compute matrix-matrix multiplication between the transpose of X and X (XTX)
